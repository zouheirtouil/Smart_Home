# Smart_Home

During this project, we tested a new approach to identifying behavioural patterns in older people, focusing on thermal sensor data. We wanted to visualise the data. 


For this we created images for each sensor measurement. By putting these images together we made videos. Then we created a function that will count the number of times people pass
through the videos.


In order to visualise these results we used histograms for each day describing the number of passages per hour.
